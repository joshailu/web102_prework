## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while implementing my new feature was styling and manipulating the page using Javascript. Functions in Javascript also work quite differently, so it was a great learning experience to do the hands-on challenges. Specifically, the arrow functions and the simplification of certain algorithms with functions like reduce() and filter() were quite helpful to learn.
